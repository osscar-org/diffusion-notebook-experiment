    "## **Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the random diffusion process inspecting it in two dimensions\n",
    "* Understand the connection between microscopic kinetics and macroscopic observables\n",
    "* Learn how to extract diffusion coefficients from the simulation of an ensemble of particles\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Simulation method**\n",
    "Below you will find an interactive visualization, representing $N$ points moving in two dimensions (2D).\n",
    "All points start from the center ($x=0, y=0$). \n",
    "At each timestep, every point moves along $x$ of an amount $l$ (called \"step size\") either on the right (with probability $p_x$) or on the left (with probability $1-p_x$). At the same time, the point moves also along $y$ of an amount $l$ either up (with probability $p_y$) or down (with probability $1-p_y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is performed in a box of finite size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulation, you can change the number of particles $N$, the step size $l$, and the probability $p_x$ (while the probability $p_y$ is fixed at $p_y=\\frac 1 2$).\n",
    "You can also decide the total number of steps in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How to use the visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Select the simulation parameters**\n",
    "- **Press the \"Simulate\" button**\n",
    "- **Then use the play/pause/stop buttons to visualize the simulation results**\n",
    "(an explanation of the plots is available in the \"Legend\" section below the visualization).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tasks**\n",
    "1. **What qualitative shape do you expect for the statistical distribution of points?** (E.g. number of peaks, narrow vs. broad distribution, symmetric vs. asymmetric, ...)? **How do you expect that it evolves over time?** Run the simulation and check if the red analytical curve drawn in the top-right plot (projecting the motion in 1D, on the x axis). **Does it agree with your expectations?**<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the number of points in the simulation (e.g. reduce them). Inspect the top-right panel. **Is the agreement between the histogram and the expected distribution affected? Why?**<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compare the global behavior and the path of an individual point (visible once the corresponding checkbox is activated). : **what do you observe?** <br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follow the path of an individual point for a long time, trying to reach the border of the simulation box. **What does the simulation do when a point reaches the border? Does this affect the realism of the simulation?** <br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the value of $p_x$ (note fewer plots are shown for $p_x\\neq \\frac 1 2$). **How does the motion of the points change? What physical effect are we mimicking?**<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set $p_x$=0.5, 1000 points, a step size of 0.05, and run for 5000 steps. The typical standard deviation $r_{std}$ (defined in the bottom section \"Legend\") can be visually inspected below as a green circle, and helps us understand the typical average \"diffusion speed\" of points. **With the help of the bottom-right panel, suggest a formula for the dependence of $r_{std}$ on time. Is the rate of change of $r_{std}$ at the beginning and at the end of the simulation the same?**\n"
